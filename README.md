# Linux-Home

these are the configuration files in my Linux Home folder/
this repo is for my personal convenience so I can download them anywhere

there is a install.sh, but I wouldn't recommend using it if you aren't me, since it is only ever configured for one repo and not meant to be run more than once/
looking into it to see how I use the files contained here might be a good idea though
